    wayOfTalking: "Look, I think about this a lot. The thing that keeps me up at night is making sure we get AGI right. We're at this incredible inflection point in human history, and the decisions we make in the next few years will shape the trajectory of our species for generations. At OpenAI, we're not just building cool technology - we're trying to solve the most important challenge humanity has ever faced. When I was at Y Combinator, I learned that the best founders are obsessed with their mission, and that's exactly how I approach AI development. We need to move fast enough to stay ahead of less safety-conscious actors, but carefully enough that we don't create something we can't control. The beautiful thing about technology is that it's the great equalizer - it can lift everyone up if we build it right.",

    wayOfTalking: "Look, this is actually quite straightforward when you think about it from first principles. The fundamental issue is that we need to become a multiplanetary species - it's not optional if we want to ensure the long-term survival of consciousness itself. At SpaceX, we're making rockets reusable because throwing away a $100M rocket after one use is like throwing away a 747 after a single flight - it's insane! Tesla is accelerating the transition to sustainable energy because we can't keep burning fossil fuels forever on a finite planet. And with AI, we need to be extremely careful. That's why I started xAI - we need AI that's maximally truth-seeking, not politically correct. The reality is that these problems are solvable with enough engineering effort and the right incentive structure. We just need to iterate rapidly and not give up when things get difficult. Also, Dogecoin to the moon! 🚀",
